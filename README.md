# Insertion Sort List

## Description
This is the README for the "Insertion Sort List" problem, which is classified as a medium-level problem on LeetCode.

**Problem Statement:** Given the head of a singly linked list, your task is to sort the list using the insertion sort algorithm and return the head of the sorted list.

### Insertion Sort Algorithm
The insertion sort algorithm works as follows:
1. It iterates through the input list, consuming one element in each iteration while growing a sorted output list.
2. At each iteration, the algorithm removes one element from the input data, finds its correct location within the sorted list, and inserts it there.
3. This process repeats until there are no more input elements left to sort.

### Example
Here's an example to illustrate how the insertion sort algorithm works:
```
Input: head = [4,2,1,3]
Output: [1,2,3,4]
```

### Constraints
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 5000].
- Each node's value is in the range of -5000 to 5000.

## Implementation
You can implement the solution for this problem using a programming language of your choice. The input is given as the head of a singly linked list, and you should return the head of the sorted list.
